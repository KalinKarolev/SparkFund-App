# SparkFund: A Java-Based Crowdfunding Platform

**SparkFund** is a donation-based crowdfunding platform built as part of a self-driven learning project to deepen skills in full-stack web development, RESTful APIs, and microservice architecture. It allows users to create and support fundraising campaigns (called "Sparks"), contribute through wallet-based donations, and track progress in real time. 

While developed for educational purposes, SparkFund simulates a real-world application with features like donation management, top donor rankings, wallet management, and email notifications via the dedicated `SparkMail` microservice. The project emphasizes clean architecture, user experience, and modular, scalable design.

## ðŸ“– About

**SparkFund** allows users to:
- Create and manage fundraising campaigns called *Sparks*.
- Donate using wallet-based transactions.
- Track funding progress and view donation history.
- View top donors and the total raised amount.
- Send signals that are reviewed and resolved by Admin users.
- Receive email notifications (via the SparkMail microservice) when donations are made, when *Sparks* are completed or cancelled, and when their signal requests are resolved.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

SparkFund is built using a modern Java-based tech stack designed for full-stack web development, RESTful API design, and microservice architecture.

### Backend

- **Java 17** â€“ Core language for building the application.
- **Spring Boot 3.4.3** â€“ Framework for rapid backend development with embedded server support.

#### Spring Boot Starters & Modules

- **Spring Web** â€“ For building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **Spring Data JPA** â€“ ORM for interacting with the database using Java entities.
- **Spring Security** â€“ Secures endpoints and handles authentication/authorization.
- **Spring Boot Validation** â€“ For input validation in forms and DTOs.
- **Spring Boot Actuator** â€“ For monitoring and health checks.
- **Spring Boot DevTools** â€“ Enables hot-reloading during development.

#### Other Backend Tools

- **Spring Cloud OpenFeign** â€“ Declarative HTTP client for communication between microservices (e.g., SparkMail).
- **Lombok** â€“ Reduces boilerplate code (e.g., getters, setters, constructors).

### Database

- **MySQL** â€“ Main relational database used in production.
- **H2** â€“ In-memory database for development and testing.
- **Hibernate (via JPA)** â€“ ORM for database persistence.

### Frontend (Server-Side Rendered)

- **Thymeleaf** â€“ Java templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML content.

### Testing

- **Spring Boot Starter Test** â€“ Includes JUnit, Mockito, and other testing utilities.
- **Spring Security Test** â€“ For testing secured routes and authentication logic.

### Build & Dependency Management

- **Maven** â€“ Project build tool and dependency manager.
- **Spring Boot Maven Plugin** â€“ For packaging and running the application.

> This stack enables modular, testable, and scalable development while mimicking production-level practices in a training project.
